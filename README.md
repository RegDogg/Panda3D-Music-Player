# Panda3D-Music-Player
A music player for seamless loop based on Panda3D to give an authentic feel to the music, with only a file!

If you would like to uild this into an executable, I highly recommend using Nuitka-Python (https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka-Python)! A guide for building will come soon!
