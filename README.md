# Panda3D-Music-Player
A music player for seamless loop based on Panda3D to give an authentic feel to the music, with only a file!

If you would like to build this into an executable, I highly recommend using Nuitka-Python (https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka-Python)! A guide for building will come soon!

Do note: This project was only started a few weeks ago, so bugs are probably going to appear, but I would be grateful if you would like to make pull requests, or report issues!

This works with Python 3.10, and future versions

# Installing Panda3D and PyQt5
Once you have installed Python (https://python.org/) you can run the following command

```sh
pip install panda3d
```

```sh
pip install pyqt5
```
