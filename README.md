# Panda3D-Music-Player
A music player for seamless loop based on Panda3D to give an authentic feel to the music, with only a file!

If you would like to build this into an executable, I highly recommend using Nuitka-Python (https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka-Python)! A guide for building will come soon!

Do note: This project was only started a few weeks ago, so bugs are probably going to appear, but I would be grateful if you would like to make pull requests, or report issues!
